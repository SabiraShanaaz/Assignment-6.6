1.Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler

      -The difference between FIFo and capacity scheduler is:

          * In FIFO scheduling the jobs are taken from the work queue.The jobs are taken in the order of oldest job first.
                  THe FIFO scheduling doen not deals with priority or the size of the job.

          * In FIFO if the old job is long the short jobs get stuck behind the long ones

          * In FIFO there is poor utilization of the job queue and it has costly data replication.

          * Whereas in capacity scheduling several queues are created, with each having a number of map and reduce tasks.

          * In capacity scheduling each queue is assigned a capacity.
                  These capacity of individual queue is added together to find the overall capacity of the cluster.

          * Unlike FIFO ,here the shortest job are assigned first followed by the longest one.



2.What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x

       -The limitations of hadoop 1.x are:

          * The major limitation of hadoop 1.x is that it supports only map reduce based batch and data processing.

          * In hadoop 1.x only one namenode is used.
               If the name node fails the entire cluster fails and this is called Single POint of failure(SPOF) in hadoop 1.x.

          * Hadoop 1.x is not suitable for real time data processing.

          * Hadoop 1.x does not support horizontal scalability.

       -Hadoop 2.x overcomes the limitation of hadoop 1.x by:

          * Hadoop 2.x supports horizontal scalability.

          * It decouples the mapreduce components responsibility into different components.

          * Haddop 2.x uses new YARN component.

          * It supports multiple namenode and multiple name space.

          * It provides high availability and high scalability. 

          * Hadoop 2.x has resource manager component, node manager component 
                 and application master component which makes it more useful.
